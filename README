Work in progress open hardware radar altimeter.

The mr_radar_frogpond test board works. The VCO and amplifier footprint and circuits are tested.
I am waiting on mr_radar_platypus (a board which tests the RF and analog circuity in the radar) to arrive from China.

The through hole vertical SMA connectors on mr_radar_sandbox sandbox test board have fairly bad performance at 3.4GHz.
I am measuring about 2dB loss across the TRL through trace (e-cal) and a S11/S22 of ~-7dB.
The traces only look acceptable up until about 2.5GHz. 
Based off some fuzzy synthetic TDR measurements, it appears most of this reflection is happening at the SMA connectors. 
The U.fl test trace works fairly well, ~-20dB S11 and S22 across 3.2GHz to 3.5GHz.
