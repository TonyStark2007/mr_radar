mr_radar is an in progress open hardware frequency modulated continuous wave radar.
It is initially intended to be a radar altimter to stabalize remote control quad-rotor helicopters and UAVs.
If I add more complex signal processing and detection, it should be capable of radar imaging.

One of the goals of this project is to make it easily reproducible and inexpensive with easily sourcable components.

The mr_radar_frogpond test board works. The VCO and amplifier footprint and circuits are tested.
I am waiting on components from mr_radar_platypus (a board with the RF and IF amplifier of the radar) to arrive.

The through hole vertical SMA connectors on the mr_radar_sandbox test board have fairly bad performance at 3.4GHz.
I am measuring about 2dB loss across the TRL through trace (e-cal) and a S11/S22 of ~-7dB.
The traces only look acceptable up until about 2.5GHz. 
Based off some fuzzy synthetic TDR measurements, it appears most of this reflection is happening at the SMA connectors. 
The U.fl test traces work fairly well, ~-20dB S11 and S22 across 3.2GHz to 3.5GHz.

The patch antenna board is built and working, with performance matching agilent ADS simulations. 

Board layout is done so using Cadsoft Eagle.
Diagrams are drawn using Dia.
