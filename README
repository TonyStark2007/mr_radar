Work in progress open hardware radar altimeter.

The mr_radar_sandbox sandbox test board has fairly bad performance up at 3.4GHz to 3.5GHz.
I am measuring about 2dB loss across the TRL through trace (e-cal) and a S11/S22 of ~-7dB.
The traces only look acceptable up until about 2.5GHz. Based off some fuzzy synthetic TDR using a VNA, I suspect this might be due to the SMA connectors. The U.fl test trace worked fairly well, ~-20dB S11 and S22 across 3.2GHz to 3.5GHz.

The mr_radar_frogpond test board works. Therefore, the VCO and amplifier footprint and circuits are tested.

Currently in progress is also some simulation of VCO linearization algorithms.
