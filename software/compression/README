I'm working on reinventing the wheel by rewriting the JPEG-LS algorithm in python for compressing radar images as a class project for a data compression course.

It isn't going to be groundbreaking or particularly efficient, but it is open source and will be designed to work on microcontrollers.

Right now, I'm assuming that it will work on a bitmap of the few highest amplitude targets, with information on the amplitude and distance. Until I get the radar flying to get some good images, I'll be using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ".hgt" files to develop and test the algorithm.
